        <h5 class="text-capitalize text-success">It established in 1949</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">You know what's awesome? Our school's basketball court! It's this big, open space where we
          can bounce and shoot basketballs. The court's got these cool lines all over, and there's this giant hoop at
          each end. You can't miss them â€“ they're like the target for all the basketball fun!

          During breaks, my buddies and I rush to the court to play. We split into teams and take turns dribbling and
          passing the ball. The best part? Trying to make that perfect shot and hearing the swish when the ball goes
          through the hoop. It's like a victory dance every time!

          I'm not the tallest player, but that doesn't stop me from having a blast. We all cheer each other on and have
          mini competitions to see who can make the most shots. And guess what? Sometimes our teachers join in too! It's
          hilarious to see them try to shoot from way far away.

          Oh, and remember that time we had a mini basketball tournament? It was epic! Different teams from our class
          played against each other, and it was so exciting. We ran around, dribbled like crazy, and high-fived like
          champions. My team didn't win, but we still got a shiny badge for trying our best.

          The basketball court is like a place where we can hang out, be active, and learn new tricks. And you know
          what? Even if we miss a shot or fumble the ball, we just laugh it off and keep playing. That's what makes it
          so much fun!</p>

        <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Tennis Court</kbd></h4>
        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-capitalize text-success">It established in 1949</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">You won't believe how cool our school tennis court is! It's like a mini sports place right
          here in our school. When you walk by, you can see people playing tennis with rackets and hitting that little
          ball back and forth.

          The court is all green with lines on it, and there's a net in the middle. It's like a challenge to get the
          ball over the net and make sure it bounces in the right spot on the other side. It's not as easy as it looks,
          but it's super fun.

          Sometimes during recess, my friends and I go to the court. We take turns hitting the ball and trying to see
          who can hit it the farthest. And when we actually hit it over the net, it feels like a big win! We're not
          pros, but we're getting better each time we play.

          There's this one teacher who knows a lot about tennis, and sometimes they come and show us some tricks. They
          teach us how to hold the racket and how to stand so we can hit the ball just right. It's like having a secret
          coach.

          I really like the tennis court because it's a place where we can have fun and learn at the same time. Maybe
          one day, I'll be really good at tennis and play like those players on TV. But for now, I'm just enjoying
          playing with my friends and getting better bit by bit.</p>
